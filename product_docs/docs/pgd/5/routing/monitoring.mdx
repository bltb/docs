Proxies can be monitored at the cluster and group level or at the process level.

## Monitoring through the cluster

### Using SQL

The current configuration of every group is visible in the [`bdr.node_group_routing_config_summary`](/pgd/latest/reference/catalogs-internal#bdrnode_group_routing_config_summary) view. 

The [`bdr.node_routing_config_summary`](/pgd/latest/reference/catalogs-internal#bdrnode_routing_config_summary) view shows current per-node routing configuration. 

[`bdr.proxy_config_summary`](/pgd/latest/reference/catalogs-internal#bdrproxy_config_summary) shows per-proxy configuration.

### Using PGD CLI

You can use the `show-proxies` command to view the current status of all proxies in the PGD cluster.
The `show-proxy` command to view the status of a specific proxy.

## Monitoring at the process level

### Proxy health check

PGD Proxy provides the following HTTP(s) health check API endpoints. The API endpoints respond to `GET` requests. You need to enable and configure the endpoints before using them. See [Configurations](installing_proxy#configuring-health-check).

```
GET /health/is-ready
GET /health/is-live
```

#### Readiness

On receiving a valid `GET` request, the proxy checks if it can successfully route connections to the current write leader. If the check returns successfully, the API responds with a body containing `true` and an HTTP status code `200 (OK)`. Otherwise, it returns a body containing `false` with the HTTP status code `500 (Internal Server Error)`.

#### Liveness

Liveness checks return either `true` with HTTP status code `200 (OK)` or an error. They never return `false` because the HTTP server listening for the request is stopped if the PGD Proxy service fails to start or exits.

## Proxy log location

Proxies also write logs to system logging where they can be monitored with other system services.

### syslog

- Debian based - `/var/log/syslog`
- Red Hat based - `/var/log/messages`

Use the `journalctl` command to filter and view logs for troubleshooting PGD Proxy. The following are few sample commands for quick reference:

```sh
journalctl -u pgd-proxy -n100 -f
journalctl -u pgd-proxy --since today
journalctl -u pgd-proxy --since "10 min ago"
journalctl -u pgd-proxy --since "2022-10-20 16:21:50" --until "2022-10-20 16:21:55"
```
